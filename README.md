FC210001 has strongest 40Hz entrainment
Sampling Rate (fs�):
The sampling rate is the number of samples per second taken from a continuous signal to create a discrete signal. It is measured in Hz (samples per second).
According to the Nyquist theorem, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal to avoid aliasing.
Frequency Resolution (Δf\Delta fΔf):
Frequency resolution is the smallest distinguishable frequency difference that can be detected in a frequency spectrum. It is determined by the total time duration of the signal (TTT).
Mathematically:
Δf=
where TTT is the total duration of the signal (the reciprocal of the frequency resolution is the time span of the analyzed signal).
